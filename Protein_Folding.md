# Protein Folding: What is it and how to get Involved

Proteins are biology's workhorses. Proteins help your body break down food into energy, regulate your moods, and fight disease. Before proteins can carry out these important functions, they assemble themselves, or "fold." While protein folding is critical and fundamental to virtually all of biology much of the process remains a mystery.

However, when proteins do not fold correctly (misfolding), there can be serious health consequences, including many well known diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Mad Cow Disease, CJD, ALS, AIDS, Huntington's, Parkinson's disease, and many cancers.

Hope is not lost, though. Several institutions, such as David E. Shaw Research, University of Washington, and Stanford University have created their own programs to be able simulate protein folding in order to learn more about how folding works and how misfolding happens. David E. Shaw Research uses Anton, a supercomputer, to be able to simulate protein folding.

Both Stanford University’s Folding@home and University of Washington’s Foldit are what are known as distributed computing projects. Basically, It is a network of computers that use their various resources to compile information from protein simulations that can be used for research on protein folding. If we better understand protein misfolding we can design drugs and therapies to combat illnesses caused by protein misfolding.

You can join Folding@home or Foldit by going to their main page, where you can find more information as well. Download the simulating program, and run it. Folding@home works in the background, so you can use your device while it is simulating. Foldit is a puzzle game that interacts with the user to fold.

This is a quick video about Folding@home and how it [works] (https://youtu.be/7sJx9z1uB9k).
