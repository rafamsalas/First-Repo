Can't really believe that we are over a third the way done with the course. We've come a long way since we first started. Everyone has finished the Eloquent Javascript worksheet Chapter 2 and is ready for the next chapter. Now that the hardest part is over, we can now move on to functions and how to use them.

On Wednesday, I presented my "Teach the Classroom Something" part for the course. I chose to talk about Simulated Protein Folding, specifically what it is and how one can get involved.
